I am currently a research assistant at the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) under the supervision of Prof. Roy Ka-Wei Lee. My research interests encompass social computing and responsible AI, with a particular emphasis on applying NLP techniques to social and business contexts. 

Prior to this position, I earned a master’s degree in Artificial Intelligence from KU Leuven, where I was supervised by Prof. Johannes De Smedt, and a master’s degree in Business Engineering from Vrije Universiteit Brussel.
